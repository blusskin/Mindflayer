9. Options
 
Due to variations in personal tastes and conceptions of how NetHack should do things, there are options you can set to change how NetHack behaves. 
 
NetHack 3.6	February 3, 2023	[Table of Contents]

9.1. Setting the options
 
Options may be set in a number of ways.  Within the game, the ‘O’ command allows you to view all options and change most of them.  You can also set options automatically by placing them in a configuration file, or in the NETHACKOPTIONS environment variable.  Some versions of NetHack also have front-end programs that allow you to set options before starting the game or a global configuration for system administrators. 
 
NetHack 3.6	February 3, 2023	[Table of Contents]

9.2. Using a configuration file
 
The default name of the configuration file varies on different operating systems. 
 
On UNIX,  Linux, and Mac OS X it is “.nethackrc” in the user's home directory.  The file may not exist, but it is a normal ASCII text file and can be created with any text editor. 
 
On Windows, it is “.nethackrc” in the folder “\%USERPROFILE%\NetHack\(rq.  The file may not exist, but it is a normal ASCII text file can can be created with any text editor.  After running NetHack for the first time, you should find a default template for the configuration file named “.nethackrc.template” in “\%USERPROFILE%\NetHack\(rq.  If you had not created the configuration file, NetHack will create the configuration file for you using the default template file. 
 
On MS-DOS, it is “defaults.nh” in the same folder as nethack.exe. 
 
Any line in the configuration file starting with ‘#’ is treated as a comment.  Empty lines are ignored. 
 
Any line beginning with ‘[’ and ending in ‘]’ is considered a section marker.  The text between the square brackets is the section name.  Lines after a section marker belong to that section, and are ignored unless a CHOOSE statement was used to select that section.  Section names are case insensitive. 
 
You can use different configuration statements in the file, some of which can be used multiple times.  In general, the statements are written in capital letters, followed by an equals sign, followed by settings particular to that statement. 
 
Here is a list of allowed statements: 
OPTIONS
There are two types of options, boolean and compound options.  Boolean options toggle a setting on or off, while compound options take more diverse values.  Prefix a boolean option with “no” or ‘!’ to turn it off.  For compound options, the option name and value are separated by a colon.  Some options are persistent, and apply only to new games.  You can specify multiple OPTIONS statements, and multiple options separated by commas in a single OPTIONS statement.  (Comma separated options are processed from right to left.) 

Example: 
 
OPTIONS=dogname:Fido
OPTIONS=!legacy,autopickup,pickup_types:$"=/!?+
HACKDIR
Default location of files NetHack needs. On Windows HACKDIR defaults to the location of the NetHack.exe or NetHackw.exe file so setting HACKDIR to override that is not usually necessary or recommended. 
LEVELDIR
The location that in-progress level files are stored. Defaults to HACKDIR, must be writable. 
SAVEDIR
The location where saved games are kept. Defaults to HACKDIR, must be writable. 
BONESDIR
The location that bones files are kept. Defaults to HACKDIR, must be writable. 
LOCKDIR
The location that file synchronization locks are stored. Defaults to HACKDIR, must be writable. 
TROUBLEDIR
The location that a record of game aborts and self-diagnosed game problems is kept. Defaults to HACKDIR, must be writable. 
AUTOCOMPLETE
Enable or disable an extended command autocompletion.  Autocompletion has no effect for the X11 windowport.  You can specify multiple autocompletions.  To enable autocompletion, list the extended command.  Prefix the command with “!” to disable the autocompletion for that command. 

Example: 
 
AUTOCOMPLETE=zap,!annotate
AUTOPICKUP_EXCEPTION
Set exceptions to the pickup_types option.  See the “Configuring Autopickup Exceptions” section. 
BINDINGS
Change the key bindings of some special keys, menu accelerators, or extended commands.  You can specify multiple bindings.  Format is key followed by the command, separated by a colon.  See the “Changing Key Bindings” section for more information. 

Example: 
 
BIND=^X:getpos.autodescribe
CHOOSE
Chooses at random one of the comma-separated parameters as an active section name. Lines in other sections are ignored. 

Example: 
 
OPTIONS=color
CHOOSE=char A,char B
[char A]
OPTIONS=role:arc,race:dwa,align:law,gender:fem
[char B]
OPTIONS=role:wiz,race:elf,align:cha,gender:mal
MENUCOLOR
Highlight menu lines with different colors.  See the “Configuring Menu Colors” section. 
MSGTYPE
Change the way messages are shown in the top status line.  See the “Configuring Message Types” section. 
ROGUESYMBOLS
Custom symbols for for the rogue level's symbol set.  See SYMBOLS below. 
SOUND
Define a sound mapping.  See the “Configuring User Sounds” section. 
SOUNDDIR
Define the directory that contains the sound files.  See the “Configuring User Sounds” section. 
SYMBOLS
Override one or more symbols in the symbol set used for all dungeon levels except for the special rogue level.  See the “Modifying NetHack Symbols” section. 

Example: 
 
# replace small punctuation (tick marks) with digits
SYMBOLS=S_boulder:0,S_golem:7
WIZKIT
Debug mode only:  extra items to add to initial inventory.  Value is the name of a text file containing a list of item names, one per line, up to a maximum of 128 lines.  Each line is processed by the function that handles wishing. 

Example: 
 
WIZKIT=~/wizkit.txt
 
 
 
 
Here is an example of configuration file contents: 
 
# Set your character's role, race, gender, and alignment. 
OPTIONS=role:Valkyrie, race:Human, gender:female, align:lawful
#
# Turn on autopickup, set automatically picked up object types
OPTIONS=autopickup,pickup_types:$"=/!?+
#
# Map customization
OPTIONS=color           # Display things in color if possible
OPTIONS=lit_corridor    # Show lit corridors differently
OPTIONS=hilite_pet,hilite_pile
# Replace small punctuation (tick marks) with digits
SYMBOLS=S_boulder:0,S_golem:7
#
# No startup splash screen. Windows GUI only. 
OPTIONS=!splash_screen

9.3. Using the NETHACKOPTIONS environment variable
 
The NETHACKOPTIONS variable is a comma-separated list of initial values for the various options.  Some can only be turned on or off.  You turn one of these on by adding the name of the option to the list, and turn it off by typing a ‘!’ or “no” before the name.  Others take a character string as a value.  You can set string options by typing the option name, a colon or equals sign, and then the value of the string.  The value is terminated by the next comma or the end of string. 
 
For example, to set up an environment variable so that color is on, legacy is off, character name is set to “Blue Meanie”, and named fruit is set to “lime”, you would enter the command
 
% setenv NETHACKOPTIONS "color,\!leg,name:Blue Meanie,fruit:lime"
in csh (note the need to escape the ‘!’ since it's special to that shell), or the pair of commands
 
$ NETHACKOPTIONS="color,!leg,name:Blue Meanie,fruit:lime"
$ export NETHACKOPTIONS
in sh, ksh, or bash. 
 
The NETHACKOPTIONS value is effectively the same as a single OPTIONS statement in a configuration file.  The “OPTIONS=” prefix is implied and comma separated options are processed from right to left.  Other types of configuration statements such as BIND or MSGTYPE are not allowed. 
 
Instead of a comma-separated list of options, NETHACKOPTIONS can be set to the full name of a configuration file you want to use.  If that full name doesn't start with a slash, precede it with ‘@’ (at-sign) to let NetHack know that the rest is intended as a file name.  If it does start with ‘/’, the at-sign is optional.

9.4. Customization options
 
Here are explanations of what the various options do.  Character strings that are too long may be truncated.  Some of the options listed may be inactive in your dungeon. 
 
Some options are persistent, and are saved and reloaded along with the game.  Changing a persistent option in the configuration file applies only to new games. 
acoustics
Enable messages about what your character hears (default on).  Note that this has nothing to do with your computer's audio capabilities.  Persistent. 
align
Your starting alignment (align:lawful, align:neutral, or align:chaotic).  You may specify just the first letter.  The default is to randomly pick an appropriate alignment.  If you prefix the value with ‘!’ or “no”, you will exclude that alignment from being picked randomly.  Cannot be set with the ‘O’ command.  Persistent. 
autodescribe
Automatically describe the terrain under cursor when asked to get a location on the map (default true).  The whatis_coord option controls whether the description includes map coordinates. 
autodig
Automatically dig if you are wielding a digging tool and moving into a place that can be dug (default false). Persistent. 
autoopen
Walking into a door attempts to open it (default true). Persistent. 
autopickup
Automatically pick up things onto which you move (default on). Persistent.  See pickup_types to refine the behavior. 
autoquiver
This option controls what happens when you attempt the ‘f’ (fire) command when nothing is quivered or readied (default false).  When true, the computer will fill your quiver or quiver sack or make ready some suitable weapon.  Note that it will not take into account the blessed/cursed status, enchantment, damage, or quality of the weapon; you are free to manually fill your quiver or quiver sack or make ready with the ‘Q’ command instead.  If no weapon is found or the option is false, the ‘t’ (throw) command is executed instead.  Persistent. 
blind
Start the character permanently blind (default false).  Persistent. 
bones
Allow saving and loading bones files (default true).  Persistent. 
boulder
Set the character used to display boulders (default is the “large rock” class symbol, ‘`’). 
catname
Name your starting cat (for example “catname:Morris”).  Cannot be set with the ‘O’ command. 
character
Synonym for “role” to pick the type of your character (for example “character:Monk”).  See role for more details. 
checkpoint
Save game state after each level change, for possible recovery after program crash (default on).  Persistent. 
checkspace
Check free disk space before writing files to disk (default on).  You may have to turn this off if you have more than 2 GB free space on the partition used for your save and level files (because too much space might overflow the calculation and end up looking like insufficient space).  Only applies when MFLOPPY was defined during compilation. 
clicklook
Allows looking at things on the screen by navigating the mouse over them and clicking the right mouse button (default off). 
cmdassist
Have the game provide some additional command assistance for new players if it detects some anticipated mistakes (default on). 
confirm
Have user confirm attacks on pets, shopkeepers, and other peaceable creatures (default on).  Persistent. 
dark_room
Show out-of-sight areas of lit rooms (default on).  Persistent. 
disclose
Controls what information the program reveals when the game ends.  Value is a space separated list of prompting/category pairs (default is “ni na nv ng nc no”, prompt with default response of ‘n’ for each candidate).  Persistent.  The possibilities are: 
 
i	-	disclose your inventory;
a	-	disclose your attributes;
v	-	summarize monsters that have been vanquished;
g	-	list monster species that have been genocided;
c	-	display your conduct;
o	-	display dungeon overview.
Each disclosure possibility can optionally be preceded by a prefix which lets you refine how it behaves.  Here are the valid prefixes: 
 
y	-	prompt you and default to yes on the prompt;
n	-	prompt you and default to no on the prompt;
+	-	disclose it without prompting;
−	-	do not disclose it and do not prompt.
The listing of vanquished monsters can be sorted, so there are two additional choices for ‘v’: 
 
?	-	prompt you and default to ask on the prompt;
#	-	disclose it without prompting, ask for sort order.
Asking refers to picking one of the orderings from a menu.  The ‘+’ disclose without prompting choice, or being prompted and answering ‘y’ rather than ‘a’, will default to showing monsters in the traditional order, from high level to low level. 

Omitted categories are implicitly added with ‘n’ prefix.  Specified categories with omitted prefix implicitly use ‘+’ prefix.  Order of the disclosure categories does not matter, program display for end-of-game disclosure follows a set sequence. 

(for example “disclose:yi na +v -g o”) The example sets inventory to prompt and default to yes, attributes to prompt and default to no, vanquished to disclose without prompting, genocided to not disclose and not prompt, conduct to implicitly prompt and default to no, and overview to disclose without prompting. 

Note that the vanquished monsters list includes all monsters killed by traps and each other as well as by you.  And the dungeon overview shows all levels you had visited but does not reveal things about them that you hadn't discovered. 
dogname
Name your starting dog (for example “dogname:Fang”).  Cannot be set with the ‘O’ command. 
extmenu
Changes the extended commands interface to pop-up a menu of available commands.  It is keystroke compatible with the traditional interface except that it does not require that you hit Enter.  It is implemented for the tty interface (default off). 

For the X11 interface, which always uses a menu for choosing an extended command, it controls whether the menu shows all available commands (on) or just the subset of commands which have traditionally been considered extended ones (off). 
female
An obsolete synonym for “gender:female”.  Cannot be set with the ‘O’ command. 
fixinv
An object's inventory letter sticks to it when it's dropped (default on).  If this is off, dropping an object shifts all the remaining inventory letters.  Persistent. 
force_invmenu
Commands asking for an inventory item show a menu instead of a text query with possible menu letters. Default is off. 
fruit
Name a fruit after something you enjoy eating (for example “fruit:mango”) (default “slime mold”).  Basically a nostalgic whimsy that NetHack uses from time to time.  You should set this to something you find more appetizing than slime mold.  Apples, oranges, pears, bananas, and melons already exist in NetHack, so don't use those. 
gender
Your starting gender (gender:male or gender:female).  You may specify just the first letter.  Although you can still denote your gender using the “male” and “female” options, the “gender” option will take precedence.  The default is to randomly pick an appropriate gender.  If you prefix the value with ‘!’ or “no”, you will exclude that gender from being picked randomly.  Cannot be set with the ‘O’ command.  Persistent. 
goldX
When filtering objects based on bless/curse state (BUCX), whether to treat gold pieces as X (unknown bless/curse state, when “on”) or U (known to be uncursed, when “off”, the default).  Gold is never blessed or cursed, but it is not described as “uncursed” even when the implicit_uncursed option is “off”. 
help
If more information is available for an object looked at with the ‘/’ command, ask if you want to see it (default on).  Turning help off makes just looking at things faster, since you aren't interrupted with the “More info?” prompt, but it also means that you might miss some interesting and/or important information.  Persistent. 
herecmd_menu
When using a windowport that supports mouse and clicking on yourself or next to you, show a menu of possible actions for the location.  Same as “#herecmdmenu” and “#therecmdmenu” commands. 
hilite_pet
Visually distinguish pets from similar animals (default off).  The behavior of this option depends on the type of windowing you use.  In text windowing, text highlighting or inverse video is often used; with tiles, generally displays a heart symbol near pets. 

With the curses interface, the petattr option controls how to highlight pets and setting it will turn the hilite_pet option on or off as warranted. 
hilite_pile
Visually distinguish piles of objects from individual objects (default off).  The behavior of this option depends on the type of windowing you use.  In text windowing, text highlighting or inverse video is often used; with tiles, generally displays a small plus-symbol beside the object on the top of the pile. 
hitpointbar
Show a hit point bar graph behind your name and title.  Only available for TTY and Windows GUI, and only when statushilites is on. 
horsename
Name your starting horse (for example “horsename:Trigger”).  Cannot be set with the ‘O’ command. 
ignintr
Ignore interrupt signals, including breaks (default off).  Persistent. 
implicit_uncursed
Omit "uncursed" from inventory lists, if possible (default on). 
legacy
Display an introductory message when starting the game (default on).  Persistent. 
lit_corridor
Show corridor squares seen by night vision or a light source held by your character as lit (default off).  Persistent. 
lootabc
When using a menu to interact with a container, use the old ‘a’, ‘b’, and ‘c’ keyboard shortcuts rather than the mnemonics ‘o’, ‘i’, and ‘b’ (default off).  Persistent. 
mail
Enable mail delivery during the game (default on).  Persistent. 
male
An obsolete synonym for “gender:male”.  Cannot be set with the ‘O’ command. 
mention_walls
Give feedback when walking against a wall (default off). 
menucolors
Enable coloring menu lines (default off).  See “Configuring Menu Colors” on how to configure the colors. 
menustyle
Controls the interface used when you need to choose various objects (in response to the Drop command, for instance).  The value specified should be the first letter of one of the following:  traditional, combination, full, or partial.  Traditional was the only interface available for early versions; it consists of a prompt for object class characters, followed by an object-by-object prompt for all items matching the selected object class(es).  Combination starts with a prompt for object class(es) of interest, but then displays a menu of matching objects rather than prompting one-by-one.  Full displays a menu of object classes rather than a character prompt, and then a menu of matching objects for selection.  Partial skips the object class filtering and immediately displays a menu of all objects.  Persistent. 
menu_deselect_all
Menu character accelerator to deselect all items in a menu.  Implemented by the Amiga, Gem, X11 and tty ports.  Default ‘−’. 
menu_deselect_page
Menu character accelerator to deselect all items on this page of a menu.  Implemented by the Amiga, Gem and tty ports.  Default ‘\’. 
menu_first_page
Menu character accelerator to jump to the first page in a menu.  Implemented by the Amiga, Gem and tty ports.  Default ‘^’. 
menu_headings
Controls how the headings in a menu are highlighted.  Values are “none”, “bold”, “dim”, “underline”, “blink”, or “inverse”.  Not all ports can actually display all types. 
menu_invert_all
Menu character accelerator to invert all items in a menu.  Implemented by the Amiga, Gem, X11 and tty ports.  Default ‘@’. 
menu_invert_page
Menu character accelerator to invert all items on this page of a menu.  Implemented by the Amiga, Gem and tty ports.  Default ‘~’.  
menu_last_page
Menu character accelerator to jump to the last page in a menu.  Implemented by the Amiga, Gem and tty ports.  Default ‘|’. 
menu_next_page
Menu character accelerator to goto the next menu page.  Implemented by the Amiga, Gem and tty ports.  Default ‘>’. 
menu_objsyms
Show object symbols in menu headings in menus where the object symbols act as menu accelerators (default off). 
menu_overlay
Do not clear the screen before drawing menus, and align menus to the right edge of the screen. Only for the tty port.  (default on)
menu_previous_page
Menu character accelerator to goto the previous menu page.  Implemented by the Amiga, Gem and tty ports.  Default ‘<’. 
menu_search
Menu character accelerator to search for a menu item.  Implemented by the Amiga, Gem, X11 and tty ports.  Default ‘:’. 
menu_select_all
Menu character accelerator to select all items in a menu.  Implemented by the Amiga, Gem, X11 and tty ports.  Default ‘.’. 
menu_select_page
Menu character accelerator to select all items on this page of a menu.  Implemented by the Amiga, Gem and tty ports.  Default ‘,’. 
monpolycontrol
Prompt for new form whenever any monster changes shape (default off).  Debug mode only. 
mouse_support
Allow use of the mouse for input and travel.  Valid settings are: 
 
0	-	disabled
1	-	enabled and make OS adjustments to support mouse use
2	-	like 1 but does not make any OS adjustments
Omitting a value is the same as specifying 1 and negating mouse_support is the same as specifying 0. 
msghistory
The number of top line messages to keep (and be able to recall with ‘^P’) (default 20).  Cannot be set with the ‘O’ command. 
msg_window
Allows you to change the way recalled messages are displayed.  Currently it is only supported for tty (all four choices) and for curses (‘f’ and ‘r’ choices, default ‘r’).  The possible values are: 
 
s	-	single message (default; only choice prior to 3.4.0);
c	-	combination, two messages as “single”, then as “full”;
f	-	full window, oldest message first;
r	-	full window reversed, newest message first.
For backward compatibility, no value needs to be specified (which defaults to “full”), or it can be negated (which defaults to “single”). 
name
Set your character's name (defaults to your user name).  You can also set your character's role by appending a dash and one or more letters of the role (that is, by suffixing one of −A −B −C −H −K −M −P −Ra −Ro −S −T −V −W). If −@ is used for the role, then a random one will be automatically chosen.  Cannot be set with the ‘O’ command. 
news
Read the NetHack news file, if present (default on).  Since the news is shown at the beginning of the game, there's no point in setting this with the ‘O’ command. 
nudist
Start the character with no armor (default false).  Persistent. 
null
Send padding nulls to the terminal (default on).  Persistent. 
number_pad
Use digit keys instead of letters to move (default 0 or off).  Valid settings are: 
 
 0 -move by letters; “yuhjklbn”  
 1 -move by numbers; digit ‘5’ acts as ‘G’ movement prefix
 2 -like 1 but ‘5’ works as ‘g’ prefix instead of as ‘G’
 3 -by numbers using phone key layout; 123 above, 789 below
 4 -combines 3 with 2; phone layout plus MS-DOS compatibility
-1 -by letters but use ‘z’ to go northwest, ‘y’ to zap wands
 
For backward compatibility, omitting a value is the same as specifying 1 and negating number_pad is the same as specifying 0.  (Settings 2 and 4 are for compatibility with MS-DOS or old PC Hack; in addition to the different behavior for ‘5’, ‘Alt-5’ acts as ‘G’ and ‘Alt-0’ acts as ‘I’.  Setting -1 is to accommodate some QWERTZ keyboards which have the location of the ‘y’ and ‘z’ keys swapped.)  When moving by numbers, to enter a count prefix for those commands which accept one (such as “12s” to search twelve times), precede it with the letter ‘n’ (“n12s”). 
packorder
Specify the order to list object types in (default “")[%?+!=/(*`0_”).  The value of this option should be a string containing the symbols for the various object types.  Any omitted types are filled in at the end from the previous order. 
paranoid_confirmation
A space separated list of specific situations where alternate prompting is desired.  The default is paranoid_confirmation:pray. 
 
Confirm -for any prompts which are set to require “yes” rather than ‘y’, also require “no” to reject instead of accepting any non-yes response as no
quit -require “yes” rather than ‘y’ to confirm quitting the game or switching into non-scoring explore mode;
die -require “yes” rather than ‘y’ to confirm dying (not useful in normal play; applies to explore mode);
bones -require “yes” rather than ‘y’ to confirm saving bones data when dying in debug mode;
attack -require “yes” rather than ‘y’ to confirm attacking a peaceful monster;
wand-break -require “yes” rather than ‘y’ to confirm breaking a wand;
eating -require “yes” rather than ‘y’ to confirm whether to continue eating;
Were-change -require “yes” rather than ‘y’ to confirm changing form due to lycanthropy when hero has polymorph control;
pray -require ‘y’ to confirm an attempt to pray rather than immediately praying; on by default;
Remove -require selection from inventory for ‘R’ and ‘T’ commands even when wearing just one applicable item. 
all -turn on all of the above. 
 
By default, the pray choice is enabled, the others disabled.  To disable it without setting any of the other choices, use “paranoid_confirmation:none”.  To keep it enabled while setting any of the others, include it in the list, such as “paranoid_confirmation:attack pray Remove”. 
perm_invent
If true, always display your current inventory in a window.  This only makes sense for windowing system interfaces that implement this feature. 
petattr
Specifies one or more text highlighting attributes to use when showing pets on the map.  Effectively a superset of the hilite_pet boolean option.  Curses interface only; value is one or more of the following letters. 
 
n	-	Normal text (no highlighting)
i	-	Inverse video (default)
b	-	Bold text
u	-	Underlined text
k	-	blinKing text
d	-	Dim text
t	-	iTalic text
l	-	Left line indicator
r	-	Right line indicator
Some of those choices might not work, particularly the final three, depending upon terminal hardware or terminal emulation software. 

Currently multiple highlight-style letters can be combined by simply stringing them together (for example, “bk”), but in the future they might require being separated by plus signs (such as “b+k”, which works already).  When using the ‘n’ choice, it should be specified on its own, not in combination with any of the other letters. 
pettype
Specify the type of your initial pet, if you are playing a character class that uses multiple types of pets; or choose to have no initial pet at all.  Possible values are “cat”, “dog”, “horse”, and “none”.  If the choice is not allowed for the role you are currently playing, it will be silently ignored.  For example, “horse” will only be honored when playing a knight.  Cannot be set with the ‘O’ command. 
pickup_burden
When you pick up an item that would exceed this encumbrance level (Unencumbered, Burdened, streSsed, straiNed, overTaxed, or overLoaded), you will be asked if you want to continue.  (Default ‘S’).  Persistent. 
pickup_thrown
If this option is on and autopickup is also on, try to pick up things that you threw, even if they aren't in pickup_types or match an autopickup exception.  Default is on.  Persistent. 
pickup_types
Specify the object types to be picked up when autopickup is on.  Default is all types.  You can use autopickup_exception configuration file lines to further refine autopickup behavior.  Persistent. 
pile_limit
When walking across a pile of objects on the floor, threshold at which the message “there are few/several/many objects here” is given instead of showing a popup list of those objects.  A value of 0 means “no limit” (always list the objects); a value of 1 effectively means “never show the objects” since the pile size will always be at least that big; default value is 5.  Persistent. 
playmode
Values are “normal”, “explore”, or “debug”.  Allows selection of explore mode (also known as discovery mode) or debug mode (also known as wizard mode) instead of normal play.  Debug mode might only be allowed for someone logged in under a particular user name (on multi-user systems) or specifying a particular character name (on single-user systems) or it might be disabled entirely.  Requesting it when not allowed or not possible results in explore mode instead.  Default is normal play. 
pushweapon
Using the ‘w’ (wield) command when already wielding something pushes the old item into your alternate weapon slot (default off).  Likewise for the ‘a’ (apply) command if it causes the applied item to become wielded.  Persistent. 
race
Selects your race (for example, “race:human”).  Default is random.  If you prefix the value with ‘!’ or “no”, you will exclude that race from being picked randomly.  Cannot be set with the ‘O’ command.  Persistent. 
rest_on_space
Make the space bar a synonym for the ‘.’ (#wait) command (default off).  Persistent. 
role
Pick your type of character (for example “role:Samurai”); synonym for “character”.  See “name” for an alternate method of specifying your role.  Normally only the first letter of the value is examined; ‘r’ is an exception with “Rogue”, “Ranger”, and “random” values.  If you prefix the value with ‘!’ or “no”, you will exclude that role from being picked randomly.  Cannot be set with the ‘O’ command.  Persistent. 
roguesymset
This option may be used to select one of the named symbol sets found within “symbols” to alter the symbols displayed on the screen on the rogue level. 
rlecomp
When writing out a save file, perform run length compression of the map.  Not all ports support run length compression. It has no effect on reading an existing save file. 
runmode
Controls the amount of screen updating for the map window when engaged in multi-turn movement (running via shift+direction or control+direction and so forth, or via the travel command or mouse click).  The possible values are: 
 
teleport -update the map after movement has finished;
run -update the map after every seven or so steps;
walk -update the map after each step;
crawl -like walk, but pause briefly after each step. 
 
This option only affects the game's screen display, not the actual results of moving.  The default is “run”; versions prior to 3.4.1 used “teleport” only.  Whether or not the effect is noticeable will depend upon the window port used or on the type of terminal.  Persistent. 
safe_pet
Prevent you from (knowingly) attacking your pets (default on).  Persistent. 
sanity_check
Evaluate monsters, objects, and map prior to each turn (default off).  Debug mode only. 
scores
Control what parts of the score list you are shown at the end (for example “scores:5 top scores/4 around my score/own scores”).  Only the first letter of each category (‘t’, ‘a’, or ‘o’) is necessary.  Persistent. 
showexp
Show your accumulated experience points on bottom line (default off).  Persistent. 
showrace
Display yourself as the glyph for your race, rather than the glyph for your role (default off).  Note that this setting affects only the appearance of the display, not the way the game treats you.  Persistent. 
showscore
Show your approximate accumulated score on bottom line (default off).  Persistent. 
silent
Suppress terminal beeps (default on).  Persistent. 
sortloot
Controls the sorting behavior of the pickup lists for inventory and #loot commands and some others.  Persistent.  The possible values are: 
 
full -always sort the lists;
loot -only sort the lists that don't use inventory letters, like with the #loot and pickup commands;
none -show lists the traditional way without sorting. 
 
sortpack
Sort the pack contents by type when displaying inventory (default on).  Persistent. 
sparkle
Display a sparkly effect when a monster (including yourself) is hit by an attack to which it is resistant (default on).  Persistent. 
standout
Boldface monsters and “−−More−−” (default off).  Persistent. 
statushilites
Controls how many turns status hilite behaviors highlight the field.  If negated or set to zero, disables status hiliting.  See “Configuring Status Hilites” for further information. 
status_updates
Allow updates to the status lines at the bottom of the screen (default true). 
suppress_alert
This option may be set to a NetHack version level to suppress alert notification messages about feature changes for that and prior versions (for example “suppress_alert:3.3.1”). 
symset
This option may be used to select one of the named symbol sets found within “symbols” to alter the symbols displayed on the screen.  Use “symset:default” to explicitly select the default symbols. 
time
Show the elapsed game time in turns on bottom line (default off).  Persistent. 
timed_delay
When pausing momentarily for display effect, such as with explosions and moving objects, use a timer rather than sending extra characters to the screen.  (Applies to “tty” interface only; “X11” interface always uses a timer based delay.  The default is on if configured into the program.)  Persistent. 
tombstone
Draw a tombstone graphic upon your death (default on).  Persistent. 
toptenwin
Put the ending display in a NetHack window instead of on stdout (default off).  Setting this option makes the score list visible when a windowing version of NetHack is started without a parent window, but it no longer leaves the score list around after game end on a terminal or emulating window. 
travel
Allow the travel command (default on).  Turning this option off will prevent the game from attempting unintended moves if you make inadvertent mouse clicks on the map window.  Persistent. 
verbose
Provide more commentary during the game (default on).  Persistent. 
whatis_coord
When using the ‘/’ or ‘;’ commands to look around on the map with autodescribe on, display coordinates after the description.  Also works in other situations where you are asked to pick a location. 

The possible settings are: 
 
c	-	compass (“east” or “3s” or “2n,4w”);
f	-	full compass (“east” or “3south” or “2north,4west”);
m	-	map <x,y> (map column x=0 is not used);
s	-	screen [row,column] (row is offset to match tty usage);
n	-	none (no coordinates shown) [default].
The whatis_coord option is also used with the “/m”, “/M”, “/o”, and “/O” sub-commands of ‘/’, where the “none” setting is overridden with “map”. 
whatis_filter
When getting a location on the map, and using the keys to cycle through next and previous targets, allows filtering the possible targets. 
 
n	-	no filtering [default]
v	-	in view only
a	-	in same area only
The area-filter tries to be slightly predictive — if you're standing on a doorway, it will consider the area on the side of the door you were last moving towards. 

Filtering can also be changed when getting a location with the “getpos.filter” key. 
whatis_menu
When getting a location on the map, and using a key to cycle through next and previous targets, use a menu instead to pick a target.  (default off)
whatis_moveskip
When getting a location on the map, and using shifted movement keys or meta-digit keys to fast-move, instead of moving 8 units at a time, move by skipping the same glyphs.  (default off)
windowtype
When the program has been built to support multiple interfaces, select which one to use, such as “tty” or “X11” (default depends on build-time settings; use “#version” to check).  Cannot be set with the ‘O’ command. 

When used, it should be the first option set since its value might enable or disable the availability of various other options.  For multiple lines in a configuration file, that would be the first non-comment line.  For a comma-separated list in NETHACKOPTIONS or an OPTIONS line in a configuration file, that would be the rightmost option in the list. 
wizweight
Augment object descriptions with their objects' weight (default off).  Debug mode only. 
zerocomp
When writing out a save file, perform zero-comp compression of the contents. Not all ports support zero-comp compression. It has no effect on reading an existing save file.
